Hi, I'm Hung, 17 years old as of 2021. I'm currently a student at HUS - High School for Gifted Students, and also a developer at VNOI.

I used to study Competitive Programming as a hobby, even though I am not so good at that, and I stopped at the end of 2020.
After that, I've done a lot of things related to Competitive Programming like hosting OIs, developing examination platforms,
etc. I also love making video games using Godot Engine or Game Maker Studio, but I haven't released any games yet :D.

I like playing games, and yeah, I play a lot. I also love reading mangas and sometimes watching some animes.
